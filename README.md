## 📖 About

**Khurakh** is an AI-powered healthcare web application that helps users instantly identify medicines and understand their purpose using **Computer Vision, OCR, Artificial Intelligence, and Full Stack Development**.

Instead of manually searching for medicine information, users can simply upload a picture of a medicine strip. The application extracts the medicine name using OCR, searches a medicine database, and displays detailed information such as:

- 💊 Medicine Name
- 🧪 Composition
- ✅ Uses
- ⚠️ Side Effects
- 💰 Price
- 🔄 Alternative Medicines

If the medicine is not available in the local database, **Groq LLaMA 3.3** intelligently generates structured medicine information in real time, ensuring users always receive helpful information.
